# Demo of Android VideoView as a ScreenSaver

When the user clicks on the text of the first screen, a video of a flame pops up. When the user clicks on the flame, the original text screen appears again. You can toggle back and forth in this way.

The gif below shows how it works.

The flame is an mp4 file which is licensed from https://archive.org/details/SlowMotionFlame "Slow Motion Flame by Sharuban" Under a creative commonds license https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/
